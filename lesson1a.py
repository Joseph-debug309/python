#what is a variaable: these are lables which act as containers to hold values. in python, a variable is always associated using some values.
#We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable.
#anything that is inside of quotes in python is called a string
message = "hello there hope everybody is fine?"
print(message)

message2 = " Good bye"
print(message2)

#concatenating variables (Joining two or more outputs together)
message3 = message + message2
print(message3)

#Variabes can be named uing a letter, variable, or underscore. they can begin with a letter underscore BUT NOT a number.
_name = "Brendah"
print(_name)

#variable names cannot contain spaces. We use the underscore to separate the names.
total_marks = 85
print(total_marks)

#variable names are not supposed to be key words/reseved characters in python
#e.g
#for = nairobi
 #   print(for)
